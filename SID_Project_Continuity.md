# SID Strategy — Project Continuity

**Living doc — git is the version history (no more numbered copies).**
**Last updated:** 30 June 2026
**Supersedes:** SID_Project_Continuity_9 (29 Mar 2026) + the iCloud `v10` draft — both archive only.
**Strategy:** v10.5.4.15 (backtest) · **Indicator:** SID Trading Signals Pro v8.5.12 (entry+confluence)

## 0. Source of truth
- **Criteria authority = `STRATEGIES.md`** (this repo). If this doc disagrees with it on a
  *criterion*, STRATEGIES.md wins.
- This doc = project history + current state. It lives in the repo on purpose: version-
  controlled, autocommitted, never drifts from the code. Do not keep a separate canonical
  copy in iCloud / Google Docs (that is what caused the March→June drift).
- LORP criteria: STRATEGIES.md + `confluence_check.py` + `LORP_optimization_log.md`.

## 1. Reconciliation log — 30 June 2026
Audit found the live criteria had drifted from the docs. STRATEGIES.md confirmed canonical;
satellites realigned:
- `analyse-brief.cjs` — Gap/ATR (3 spots) corrected to **≥2.0 ideal · <1.5 avoid**.
- `rules.json` — Gap/ATR fixed; stale LORP/SID notes rewritten; template risk-rules pruned
  (kept: no-first-15-min, Gap/ATR, RVOL>1, prefer-ETFs).
- `lorp_monitor.py` (+ checklist) — verdict now the canonical MACD0 + LC Buy gate; six
  factors demoted to "context, not validated."
- Versions corrected: strategy → v10.5.4.15; indicator → v8.5.12 (STRATEGIES.md updated).
- **ADX band resolved:** defer to STRATEGIES.md — SID danger zone = **20–25** (<20 choppy).
  v9 §25's "30–40 danger" (4-ticker set) is archived as superseded.

## 2. SID = trend pullback continuation (confirmed)
Works when: clear underlying trend (SMA50/200 aligned) + temporary counter-move pushes RSI
to OB/OS + (**ideal, NOT required**) a visible **H&S / Inv H&S** structure — flat is
lower-quality, not an auto-skip + a clean bounce (RSI does NOT re-enter OS/OB) + MACD
histogram keeps converging post-entry.

## 3. SID entry/exit logic — from indicator source v8.5.12 (authoritative)
- **Long entry:** OS touch (RSI ≤ 30) within last **10 bars** · RSI < 50 · RSI rising ·
  **MACD line rising** (`macd_slope_bars`=1; note: SID uses MACD-line *slope*, NOT MACD-vs-
  Signal like LORP) · valid SL · flat · >5 bars since last exit.
- **Short entry:** OB touch (RSI ≥ 70) within 10 bars · RSI > 50 · RSI falling · MACD line
  falling · valid SL · flat · >5 bars since exit.
- **SL (ADOPTED baseline — not varied):** the SID strategy stop — `floor(lowest_low)`
  (long) / `ceil(highest_high)` (short) from the setup swing — adjusted at David's
  discretion at the time. The SL1/SL2 variants were evaluated and NOT adopted; no reason
  to vary the baseline.
- **Exit:** RSI crosses 50 (long: crossover; short: crossunder), >3 bars after entry.
- **MACD vs Signal (MACD0):** a SUPPLEMENTARY check used both before entry and during/after
  the trade — but NOT the primary driver once the entry signal has fired (the SID entry signal
  + RSI-50 exit remain primary). Distinct from the entry trigger above, which uses MACD-line slope.
- **Weekly RSI:** raw value, for a manual visual direction check only. (The computed **Weekly
  RSI Gate** & **Weekly MACD Align** were REMOVED — proved unreliable in coding.)
- **Gap/ATR Ratio** (data-window): `(close−swing_low or swing_high−close)/close ÷ ATR%`,
  10-bar swing as SL proxy. **Indicator comment confirms ">=2.0 ideal."** ✅ matches canonical.
- Data-window outputs: SID Armed Long/Short, **ADX + DI+/DI-** (Aroon dropped in favour of
  ADX+DI), ATR%, Gap/ATR Ratio, Weekly RSI (raw), SMA200. REMOVED: Weekly RSI Gate, Weekly
  MACD Align, Aroon Osc.

## 4. Validated findings still standing
- **Pre-entry danger flags (2+ = avoid):** F1 Gap/ATR < 1.5 · F2 ADX 20–25 (per STRATEGIES.md)
  · F3 MACD0 normalised <5 or >95 · F4 RVOL < 0.75. Worst combo F1+RVOL<1.0 = 64% SL.
- **RVOL:** <0.75 = 50–68% SL; >2.0 = 72% WR. **ATR%:** <2% tight-SL trap; >3% reduce size.
- **SL distance:** main stop-hit predictor — <2% hit >70%; wider safer.
- **Sectors:** favour Financials, Real Estate, Utilities, Consumer Defensive, **ETFs** (~4.0
  PF). Avoid Energy, Technology, Materials, Communication.
- **Direction:** longs primary (~55% post-2020, PF ~2); shorts weaker (~47%) — bear regime,
  viable sectors, ADX>25, smaller size.
- **Exit:** strongest signal = RSI re-entry into OS/OB (10% vs 70% WR).
